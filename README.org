Warning: This is bound to get out of date, so look at the documentation in the source.

#+begin_src lisp :exports results

(documentation 'sijo-doctest::test 'function)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
Test extracts and tests code snippets embedded in the documentation string
   of <thing>. It returns the number of tests failed and passed and prints a
   description to <output>.

   In order to have a code snippet evaluated as a doctest it must be preceded by
   two '>' characters followed by whitespace. That combination will cause the
   next form to be read and evaluated, and the next or the two next forms after
   that to be read (but not evaluated).

   Here is the simplest possible example:

   >> 1 ; NOTE! You can use comments to clarify!
   1

   If you expect more than one value you should use the values function in the
   expected results.

   >> (values 1 2)
   (values 1 2)

   Newlines and other whitespace (including comments) doesn't particularly
   matter. We could just as well have written >> (values 1
   2) (values 1 2) instead.

   If you test a thing that doesn't have a documentation string, test will
   return (values 0 0).
   ECL NOTE: I pass an empty string here as redefining a function in ECL won't
   remove the old docstring unless a docstring is explicitly passed.

   >> (defun sqr (x)
        ""
        (* x x))
   'SQR
   >> (sijo-doctest::test #'sqr)
   (values 0 0)

   If you need to test that a function signals a condition for certain inputs
   you can use the name of the condition as the expected return value.

   >> (sqr 'x)
   'TYPE-ERROR

   If we add a documentation string for sqr with a doctest, we can verify that
   tests can fail as well.

   >> (defun sqr (x)
        "Returns <x> squared.

          This test will fail:
          >> (sqr 3) 3"
        (* x x))
   'SQR

   Testing sqr with test should now return 1 failed and 0 passed.

   >> (sijo-doctest::test #'sqr)
   (values 1 0)

   If you need to test the output of a function you can add an expected output
   form (written as -> <expected-output>) *between* the function call and the
   return value. Expected output must be one form so you should either use a
   string or wrap it in '|' characters.

   >> (defun sqr (x)
        "Prints <x> * <x> = <x*x> to standard output and returns NIL.

          This test will pass,

          >> (sqr 2)
          -> |2 * 2 = 4|
          NIL

          as will this, because it ignores the output.

          >> (sqr 2)
          NIL

          Perhaps surprisingly, this will pass as well,

          >> (sqr 2) -> |2*2=4| NIL

          the reason it passes even though it doesn't exactly match the
          actual output is because the comparison is done after all
          whitespace characters are removed.

          This test will fail because expected output doesn't match the
          actual output.

          >> (sqr 2)
          -> |Blah blah blah|
          NIL"
        (format t "~A * ~A = ~A" x x (* x x)))
   'SQR

   Testing sqr with test should now return 1 failed and 2 passed. It should
   also inform us that:

   (SQR 2) printed "2 * 2 = 4", expected "Blah blah blah".
   Results for SQR (FUNCTION): 1 of 4 failed.

   NOTE! Whitespace is ignored when output is compared.

   >> (sijo-doctest::test #'sqr :output T)
   -> |[4] (SQR 2) printed "2 * 2 = 4", expected "Blah blah blah".
       Results for SQR (FUNCTION): 1 of 4 failed.|
   (values 1 3)
