This fork has some minor differences to the upstream version:
- Tweaked to evaluate expected results to avoid problems with fset and readtables; #{||} cannot be used, and (fset:empty-map) neither
- Improved working with multiple values
- Added a test-package function to test all functions in a package
- Only print when tests are failing (useful when testing entire packages)
- RUN-DOCTESTS doesn't throw on empty docstring (triggered eof error)
