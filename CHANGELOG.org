*** Fixed
- ~test-file~ didn't work. It had a typo in the ~test-docstring~ function name
  and passed the file instead of the file content.
*** Security

** [[https://github.com/simendsjo/sijo-doctest/compare/9e591638cc8619a141ed44b65bb23d318f2bfc67..v0.4.0][0.4.0]] - 2024-03-15
*** Added
- [[https://github.com/simendsjo/sijo-doctest/issues/7][issue#7]] All test functions accepts a ~:test~ keyword to supply another testing
  functions than ~cl:equalp~. This allows passing e.g. ~generic-cl:equalp~ to
  test classes.
*** Changed
*** Deprecated
*** Removed
*** Fixed
- [[https://github.com/simendsjo/sijo-doctest/issues/6][issue#6]] Extracting docstrings now works for functions without docstrings and with
  ~(declare)~ form.

** [[https://github.com/simendsjo/sijo-doctest/compare/v0.3..v0.3.1][0.3.1]] - 2024-03-11
*** Added
*** Changed
*** Deprecated
*** Removed
*** Fixed
- ~test-package~ return failed/passed, not just ~nil~
*** Security

** [[https://github.com/simendsjo/sijo-doctest/compare/v0.2..v0.3][0.3.0]] - 2024-03-11
*** Added
- Support Embedded Common Lisp (ECL)
- Support Clozure Common Lisp (CCL)
- Support Armed Bear Common Lisp (ABCL)
- ~test-docstring~ for testing strings -- simplifies testing
- ~test-variable~ for testing variables
*** Changed
- Don't require an exact error, but rather a subclass of the expected error,
  e.g. expecting ~type-error~ will allow a subclass like ~simple-type-error~.
- The general ~test~ is exported
- ~test~ runs ~test-package~ for ~package~
- ~test~ supports ~null~
- ~test~ supports ~string~
- ~test~ for symbol will test both variable and function/macro bound to that symbol
- Number of failed/passed tests is always returned, also when there are no
  doctests for a thing, rather than ~nil~
*** Deprecated
*** Removed
*** Fixed
- ~test-package~ only includes symbols for the package under test
- ~test-package~ works for macros
*** Security

** [[https://github.com/simendsjo/sijo-doctest/commit/039516e828b5737569350a13ffc90c2d8346ad8c][0.2.0]] - 2024-03-01
*** Added
- ~test-package~ function to test all functions in a package
*** Changed
- Tweaked to evaluate expected results to avoid problems with ~fset~ and
  readtables; ~#{||}~ cannot be used, and ~(fset:empty-map)~ neither
- Improved working with multiple values
- Print only when tests are failing (useful when testing entire packages)
*** Deprecated
*** Removed
*** Fixed
- ~run-doctests~ doesn't throw on empty docstring (triggered eof error)
*** Security
